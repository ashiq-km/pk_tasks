# 🔆 Overview

This repository contains my implementation for the AI Assignment aimed at evaluating end-to-end AI/ML skills, covering:

- Data understanding & preprocessing
- Model building (ML / DL)
- AI logic & explainability
- Deployment readiness via API
- Git hygiene & documentation

The project is being developed incrementally, and this README will be updated as each task is completed.

## ☠️ Objectives

- Demonstrate data handling and preprocessing skills
- Build and evaluate machine learning / deep learning models
- Explain model choice and feature impact
- Expose predictions via a production-style API
- Follow clean Git practices and documentation standards

⚠️ Note: The structure will expand as subsequent tasks are implemented.

# ✅ Task 1: Data Understanding & Preprocessing (In Progress)

Objective:

- Evaluate data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering skills.
- Dataset Used
- Adult Census Income Dataset (Kaggle)
- Mixed data types:
- Numerical features (age, hours-per-week, etc.)
- Categorical features (workclass, education, occupation, etc.)
- Missing values represented as ?

## 📌 Project Management

Development is tracked using GitHub Issues & Project Board

Each task and sub-task is logged as an issue for better traceability
